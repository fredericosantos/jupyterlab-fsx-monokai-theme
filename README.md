# fredericosantos/jupyterlab-fsx-monokai-theme

Jupyterlab theme extension inspired by Monokai and Tailwind

Alpha stages of what I hope will become a great dark theme! I'm new to coding, new to GitHub (to actually use it) and I apologise if you're installing this and it breaks everything. Be very welcome to give me a helping hand and/or guide me. Thanks :)

## Prerequisites

* JupyterLab

## Installation

```bash
jupyter labextension install @fredericosantos/jupyterlab-fsx-monokai-theme
```

## Development

For a development install (requires npm version 4 or later), do the following in the repository directory:

```bash
npm install
jupyter labextension link .
```

To rebuild the package and the JupyterLab app:

```bash
npm run build
jupyter lab build
```
